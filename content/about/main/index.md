  Hi üëãüèª, I‚Äôm a senior high school student from New Delhi, India and I want to pursue deep learning in my higher education. I currently work as a author at Weights and Biases.
  
  Before that, I‚Äôve worked as a Front-End Developer with 6 months of internship experience in a leading educational startup. I also have a tech firm which I started with a couple of friends and we take industry projects for App and Web development. I‚Äôve also worked a lot with IoT and Robotics having won multiple hackathon‚Äôs and represented my projects in the National Science Exhibition consecutively for 2 years. Two of my projects on Fake News Classification and Regression Analysis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis are currently being mentored by Intel under the AI 4 Youth program.

  I'm an incoming freshman at the University of Edinburgh (Bsc Hons Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science)

  I‚Äôm currently learning about Attention, Self-Supervised Representation Learning, Graphical Models and Medical Imaging (Prognosis, some regression analysis as well).

  I‚Äôve worked a lot with Tensorflow, Pytorch, JAX Based ecosystems (Trax, Flax, Objax, ‚Ä¶).
