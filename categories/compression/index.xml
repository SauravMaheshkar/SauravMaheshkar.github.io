But in many ways, over-parameterization is behind the success of modern-day deep learning. Think about something like Switch Transformer having a trillion parameters or Vision Transformer-Huge having 632M parameters. These models require enormous amounts of computation and memory and that not only increases the infrastructure costs, but also makes deployment to resource-constrained environments such as mobile phones or smart devices challenging.</description></item></channel></rss>
